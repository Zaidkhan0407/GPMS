#### Advanced Scoring Algorithm
```python
class RecommendationEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.weights = {
            'technical_skills': 0.35,
            'semantic_match': 0.25,
            'experience': 0.20,
            'education': 0.15,
            'domain': 0.05
        }
        self.bert_model = load_bert_model('bert-base-uncased')
        
    def calculate_matching_score(self, candidate, job_posting):
        # Technical Skills Scoring using TF-IDF
        skills_score = self.calculate_skill_match(
            candidate.skills,
            job_posting.required_skills,
            weights=self.skill_importance_weights
        )
        
        # Semantic Understanding using BERT
        semantic_score = self.calculate_semantic_similarity(
            candidate.experience_description,
            job_posting.job_description
        )
        
        # Experience Level Match
        exp_score = self.calculate_experience_match(
            candidate.years_experience,
            job_posting.required_experience
        )
        
        # Final Weighted Score
        final_score = (
            skills_score * self.weights['technical_skills'] +
            semantic_score * self.weights['semantic_match'] +
            exp_score * self.weights['experience'] +
            self.education_score * self.weights['education'] +
            self.domain_score * self.weights['domain']
        )
        
        return final_score
```

#### HR Ranking System

##### Automated Screening Process
1. **Initial Filtering**:
   ```python
   def initial_screening(candidate):
       mandatory_criteria = {
           'education_level': 'Bachelor',
           'min_experience': 2,
           'required_skills': ['Python', 'ML']
       }
       
       return all(
           candidate.meets_criteria(key, value)
           for key, value in mandatory_criteria.items()
       )
   ```

2. **Behavioral Assessment**:
   ```python
   def behavioral_score(candidate_responses):
       behavior_weights = {
           'leadership': 0.3,
           'teamwork': 0.3,
           'problem_solving': 0.4
       }
       
       return sum(
           score * behavior_weights[category]
           for category, score in candidate_responses.items()
       )
   ```

#### Real-World Use Cases

1. **Technical Role Matching**:
```python
def match_technical_role(candidate, job):
    # Case: Senior Software Engineer Position
    technical_threshold = 0.75
    leadership_threshold = 0.60
    
    technical_score = calculate_technical_match(candidate, job)
    leadership_score = assess_leadership_capabilities(candidate)
    
    return {
        'qualified': technical_score >= technical_threshold \
                     and leadership_score >= leadership_threshold,
        'technical_score': technical_score,
        'leadership_score': leadership_score
    }
```

2. **Entry-Level Assessment**:
```python
def assess_entry_level(candidate, job):
    # Case: Fresh Graduate Position
    weights = {
        'academic_performance': 0.4,
        'internship_experience': 0.3,
        'technical_skills': 0.2,
        'extracurricular': 0.1
    }
    
    scores = {
        'academic': calculate_academic_score(candidate.gpa),
        'internship': evaluate_internships(candidate.internships),
        'skills': assess_technical_skills(candidate.skills),
        'extra': evaluate_activities(candidate.activities)
